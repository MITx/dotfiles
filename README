This repo has a collection of dotfiles 
for setting up your bash shell, git, 
and screen

The color scheme assumes a dark background 
on your terminal. 

Steps to install:


$ clone git@github.com:MITx/dotfiles
$ bash dotfiles/setup.sh

This will create symlinks from $HOME to
each file and directory

If you have an existing dotfile it will be renamed
to .<file>.bak

You will need to update .gitconfig with your name and email
