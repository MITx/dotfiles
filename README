This repo has a collection of dotfiles 
for setting up bash and git

The color scheme assumes a dark background 
on your terminal. 

Features

 - Will give you a big prompt, if you don't
   like big prompts you probably don't want
   this
 - Git status in your prompt
    * tracked/untracked files
    * branch name
    * commit status
 - Put the return status of the last command in 
   your prompt
 - Organize your bash history into the .bash_histories/ dir 


Steps to install:

$ git clone git@github.com:MITx/dotfiles
$ bash dotfiles/setup.sh

This will create symlinks from $HOME to
each file and directory

If you have an existing dotfile it will be renamed
to .<file>.bak
